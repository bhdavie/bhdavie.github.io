title: The 2017 French Presidential Election
---


Project Description:

Political science has always been of interest to me. For my third Metis project, I analyzed the 2017 French presidential election and built a model to determine the winner of individual towns throughout the country. I was able to build the model using voting and demographic data from INSEE, the French national statistics bureau. 

My analysis is based purely off the datasets I acquired so results may differ slightly from other publications or the media. I also focused my model on town predictions in mainland France; overseas departments and territories were not incorporated in the model.

I hope you enjoy! 



Prologue:


Since the 1950s, France has always been governed either by a moderate left party such as the Socialist Party or a moderate right party such as the Republicans. The 2017 presidential election, however, marked a shift from the norm as a wave of populist movements swept its way through Western democracies. The results of the French election would not only impact the people of France but the European continent as a whole. Let’s take a look at France’s unique election cycle.



French Presidential Election: How does it Work?

-	France elects a new president once every 5 years.
-	Anyone who secures 500 valid sponsorships from elected officials can run for office. 
-	The president is decided by popular vote.
-	A first round of voting is held. If a candidate fails to secure over 50% of the vote in the first round then the election moves to a second round where the top two candidates by popular vote face each other in a run-off. A candidate has never secured the presidency in the first round.
-	The second round of voting is held. The winner of the popular vote becomes president.



Why Look at Towns?

With the president determined by popular vote, a presidential candidate gains no added value for winning an individual town or department. However, identifying the winners of individual towns across France provides us a unique view of the French voter that may otherwise be overlooked. The voting patterns of a given town may be tied to the demographics and characteristics of the town, which can help candidates better understand their constituents.
